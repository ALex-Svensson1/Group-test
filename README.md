# Poe cheat sheet

## beginer information:
**1.** Choose a character you wanna play.

**2.** Find a build on youtube or on maxroll (note! when searching for a build use the right lueage for example: settlers of kalguur).

**3.** When starting out it is recommended to use a loot filter beacause it could get overwelming with the amount of loot that drop later on the game u could find some filters in the poe website (NeverSink-3Strict-softcore).

**4.** Since none of the 7 Classes actually have any baseline skills, you have a lot of freedom when it comes to your skill choice. In this game, Skills are itemised in the form of Active Skill Gems. Supports Gems then further modify or boost an Active Skill Gem by buffing its damage or altering its behavior. These Gems need to be inserted into appropriate coloured and linked sockets in your items

**5.** what does the diffrent collores represent? : <span style="color:red">red</span> = strength, <span style="color:green">green</span> = dexterity and <span style="color:blue">blue</span> = intelligence.

**6.** **links and sockets :** Sockets in items can be linked or unlinked, indicated by a small line connecting them. Generally you want to get as many links as possible especially for your main skill (up to the maximum of 6 in Body Armours/Two-Handed Weapons)

**7.** **leveling up :** While skills aren't tied to a class, they do level up with you. When a gem has gathered enough XP, an icon appears on the right side of the screen, indicating that it's ready to level. You can choose to click on it and continue (standard) or right-click it to stop leveling it (rarely). **Note that when leveling up a gem it will also raise their required level and attributes**.

For each level up you also earn one passive point to spend on the Passive Skill Tree. There are ways to respec these points through <img src="OrbOfRegret.png" width =19 height=16>***Orb of Regret*** but you won't have access to enough of them early in the game.

For the best gameplay experience, make sure that you are following a build guide. It takes away the planning needed to make a build work on your own and allows you to focus on learning more of the game's core mechanics.
